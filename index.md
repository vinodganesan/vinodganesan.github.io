I'm a Second year Masters student at IIT Madras, advised by Prof. [V. Kamakoti](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MTg=).

My research interests broadly include specialized computer architectures. My current focus is on developing energy efficient hardware accelerators for Deep Learning Applications. I am particularly looking to develop Hardware Architectures which exploit the underlying sparsity in DNNs.


I am also primarily involved in the [SHAKTI processor program](http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/rise1/projects/shakti.html), where I developed the Floating Point Unit and the peripherals for a Micro-Controller class Processor (**C-Class Processors**), which is **taped-out** in **Intel's 22nm FFL process**. The chip is expected by May 2018. I am also driving the Vector Processor development effort in the SHAKTI group. 

The SHAKTI C-Class codebase can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class).
 
The Vector-Processor (in its initial phase) codebase can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/casl/shakti_public/src/a07bfad52040965d667df5613b2a280b482d38e0/cores/common_modules/VectorAccel/?at=master).
